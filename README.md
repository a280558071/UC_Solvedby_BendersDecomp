# Unit Commitment solved with/without Benders Decomposition
You are suggested to read "UC.pdf" (in Chinese) for more information.
This is a MATLAB program example for Unit Commitment problem. You could choose to solve it with/without Benders Decomposition (BD). 
The YALMIP function export() is used to export optimization model parameters for BD.
